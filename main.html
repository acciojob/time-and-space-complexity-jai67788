	<h1>Time,Space,Complexity</h1>
	<p>The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time it takes for each statement to complete. As a result, it is highly dependent on the size of the processed data. It also aids in defining an algorithm's effectiveness and evaluating its performance.11 Oct 2023

	<p> <b>Space Complexity</b>O(n) – linear complexity – takes space directly proportional to the input size. O(n log n) – log-linear/quasilinear complexity – also called “linearithmic”, its space complexity grows proportionally to the input size and a logarithmic factor.
